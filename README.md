# Icebreaker-API
PHP API for the Icebreaker App

Hello everyone!  This is my API for the Icebreaker App.  As of now, when you go to local host with HTTP parameters of userGiven and passGiven, which are the username and password respectively, the API will check if your username and password exist on the MySQL database and if they match.  If they do, the index.php file goes through the different methods specified.  The methods of the API work all I need to figure out now is how to make them work with the main Icebreaker app.  Wish me luck!









#Bugs
I need to change the getNearbyUsers() function to use an algorithm to return users within a square mile rather than anyone within 10% of my coordinates
